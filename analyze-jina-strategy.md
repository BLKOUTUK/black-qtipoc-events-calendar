# JinaAI Strategy Analysis

## Current Issues with Implementation

1. **API Usage**: Currently using both Search and Reader APIs sequentially:
   - Search API to find event URLs
   - Reader API to extract details from each URL
   - This creates a 2-step process that's slow and expensive

2. **Search API Limitations**:
   - Returns general web results, not specifically events
   - Results include lots of irrelevant content mixed with event listings
   - May not find recent/upcoming events effectively

3. **Reader API Challenges**:
   - Each URL extraction takes 10-20 seconds
   - Many event pages are complex with login requirements
   - Timeout issues causing the "wheel of death"

## Better Strategy Options

### Option 1: Reader-First Approach
Instead of searching broadly, use Reader API on known event sources:
- r.jina.ai/https://eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom/black-events
- r.jina.ai/https://eventbrite.com/d/united-kingdom/qtipoc-events  
- r.jina.ai/https://outsavvy.com/black-lgbtq-events
- Direct scraping of known community event pages

**Pros**: More targeted, faster, higher success rate
**Cons**: Limited to known sources

### Option 2: Search with Better Filtering
Improve search queries and result filtering:
- Use more specific search terms
- Filter by date/location in the search query
- Better parsing of search results to identify actual event listings

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use Search API for discovery of new event sources/organizations
- Use Reader API only on confirmed event listing pages
- Cache and reuse successful sources

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1**: Reader-first with known sources
- Focus on Eventbrite category pages that are known to contain QTIPOC+ events
- Use Reader API to extract structured event listings
- Much faster and more reliable

**Phase 2**: Add intelligent search
- Use Search API to find new community organizations
- Extract their event pages and add to known sources
- Build a growing database of reliable event sources

This approach would be much more robust and avoid the timeout issues.
