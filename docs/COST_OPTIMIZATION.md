## 🎯 Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Smart Caching
```javascript
// Cache Google Sheets data for 5 minutes
const CACHE_DURATION = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
const cachedData = localStorage.getItem('events-cache');
const cacheTime = localStorage.getItem('events-cache-time');

if (cachedData && Date.now() - cacheTime < CACHE_DURATION) {
  return JSON.parse(cachedData);
}
```

### 2. Efficient API Calls
```javascript
// Batch multiple operations
const batchUpdate = {
  valueInputOption: 'RAW',
  data: [
    { range: 'Events!A2:M2', values: [eventData1] },
    { range: 'Events!A3:M3', values: [eventData2] }
  ]
};
```

### 3. Optimized Images
- Use Pexels URLs (free, optimized)
- Implement lazy loading
- Compress uploaded images
