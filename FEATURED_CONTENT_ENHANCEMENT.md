CREATE TABLE weekly_featured_content (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  caption TEXT,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  link_url TEXT,
  week_start DATE NOT NULL,
  display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Carousel Props
```typescript
<FeaturedHeroCarousel
  featuredContent={featuredContent}  // Required: Array of FeaturedContent
  autoPlayInterval={5000}            // Optional: milliseconds (default: 5000)
/>
```

To disable auto-rotation: Set `autoPlayInterval={0}`

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Visual Tests
- [ ] Carousel displays at top of page (between action bar and filter bar)
- [ ] Hero image covers full carousel area
- [ ] Text overlay is readable with gradient

- [ ] CTA button appears when link_url exists
- [ ] Navigation arrows appear (only if > 1 item)
- [ ] Dot indicators appear (only if > 1 item)
- [ ] Slide counter appears in top-right (only if > 1 item)

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Auto-rotation advances every 5 seconds
- [ ] Hover pauses auto-rotation
- [ ] Mouse leave resumes auto-rotation
- [ ] Left arrow navigates to previous slide
- [ ] Right arrow navigates to next slide
- [ ] Clicking dots jumps to specific slide
- [ ] "Learn More" button opens correct URL in new tab
- [ ] Carousel wraps around (last → first, first → last)

### Admin Tests

- [ ] Clicking opens Featured Content Manager modal
- [ ] Modal has proper header and close button
- [ ] Closing modal reloads carousel content
- [ ] New featured content appears in carousel immediately
- [ ] Editing featured content updates carousel
- [ ] Deleting featured content removes from carousel
- [ ] Inactive featured content doesn't show in carousel

### Responsive Tests
- [ ] Mobile (< 768px): Carousel height = 256px
- [ ] Tablet (768-1024px): Carousel height = 320px
- [ ] Desktop (> 1024px): Carousel height = 384px
- [ ] Text sizes scale appropriately
- [ ] Buttons remain clickable on all screen sizes
- [ ] Dot indicators don't overflow on mobile

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No featured content: Carousel doesn't render
- [ ] Single featured item: No arrows/dots/counter shown
- [ ] Missing image_url: Handles gracefully
- [ ] No link_url: CTA button doesn't render
- [ ] Long title/caption: Text doesn't overflow
- [ ] Image load error: Handles gracefully

## 🎯 Benefits Over Previous System

### Before: Interleaved Featured Cards
- Featured images scattered among event cards
- Only one visible at a time (requires scrolling)
- Smaller card format (less impact)
- Competed with events for attention
- No dedicated management UI

### After: Hero Carousel
- ✅ **Prominent placement** - First thing users see
- ✅ **Multiple visible** - Auto-rotation shows all featured content
- ✅ **Larger format** - Full-width hero images with bigger text
- ✅ **Dedicated space** - Doesn't interfere with event browsing
- ✅ **Easy management** - Dedicated admin button and modal
- ✅ **Better engagement** - Auto-rotation + manual controls

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- ✅ **Conditional rendering** - Carousel only mounts if content exists
- ✅ **Single interval** - Only one timer runs for auto-rotation
- ✅ **Cleanup** - useEffect properly cleans up intervals
- ✅ **Pause on hover** - Prevents unwanted slides during interaction
- ✅ **Lazy loading** - Images load as needed
- ✅ **Lightweight** - No external carousel libraries needed

### Loading Behavior
1. Page loads → `loadFeaturedContent()` called
2. Fetches active featured content for current week
3. Filters by `status === 'active'`
4. Sorts by `display_order`
5. Passes to carousel component
6. Carousel mounts with first slide visible
7. Auto-rotation starts after mount

## 📊 Database Query

The carousel uses this query (via `featuredContentService`):

```typescript
// Get current week's featured content
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('weekly_featured_content')
  .select('*')
  .eq('status', 'active')
  .lte('week_start', currentDate)
  .order('display_order', { ascending: true });
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] **Image upload** - Direct file upload instead of URL input
- [ ] **Preview mode** - Preview carousel before saving
- [ ] **Drag-to-reorder** - Visual reordering of slides
- [ ] **Analytics** - Track click-through rates on CTA buttons
- [ ] **Scheduling** - Auto-activate/deactivate based on dates
- [ ] **A/B testing** - Test different featured content variations
- [ ] **Video support** - Allow video backgrounds instead of images
- [ ] **Multiple carousels** - Different carousels for different sections
- [ ] **Transition effects** - Fade, slide, or zoom transitions
- [ ] **Mobile swipe** - Touch gestures for mobile navigation

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Image format**: Requires external image URLs (no upload yet)
2. **Week-based**: Content organized by week_start dates
3. **Single carousel**: Only one carousel per page
4. **No transitions**: Simple instant slide changes (not fade/slide)
5. **Fixed interval**: All slides use same auto-play interval
