## üéØ Multi-Source Event Aggregation System

### üîÑ Collection Architecture
The system employs a comprehensive multi-source approach with intelligent coordination:

**Priority-Based Sources:**
1. **API Integration** (Priority 1): Known QTIPOC+ organizations on Eventbrite, targeted Outsavvy searches
2. **RSS Feed Monitoring** (Priority 2): UK Black Pride, BLM UK, Stonewall UK, Gendered Intelligence, Black Cultural Archives
3. **Web Scraping** (Priority 3): Time Out London LGBT, Resident Advisor, Southbank Centre, Rich Mix, Black History Month events

### üß† Relevance Scoring Algorithm
Sophisticated keyword matching with weighted scoring across multiple dimensions:

- **Identity Keywords** (10 points): `black`, `qtipoc`, `trans`, `queer`, `lgbtq`, `genderqueer`
- **Community Keywords** (7 points): `poc`, `bipoc`, `intersectional`, `community`, `solidarity`
- **Values Keywords** (5 points): `liberation`, `justice`, `healing`, `safe space`, `activism`
- **Cultural Keywords** (4 points): `afrobeats`, `caribbean`, `spoken word`, `heritage`
- **Event Type Keywords** (2-3 points): `workshop`, `celebration`, `arts`, `music`, `support group`

### üîç Quality Control System
**Multi-layered filtering approach:**
- Minimum relevance threshold: 10-15 points depending on source
- Event likelihood detection using date/time/location patterns
- Source credibility weighting
- Content completeness scoring
- Fuzzy deduplication with 70% similarity threshold

### üéõÔ∏è Orchestration Strategies
**Collection modes:**
- **Comprehensive**: All sources (4+ minute runtime, maximum coverage)
- **Priority Only**: API sources only (1-2 minute runtime, high-quality events)  
- **Fast**: APIs + RSS feeds (2-3 minute runtime, balanced approach)

### üîß Deduplication Engine
**Intelligent merge system:**
- Levenshtein distance calculation for fuzzy string matching
- Multi-factor similarity: title (35%), description (20%), date (25%), location (15%), organizer (5%)
- Quality-based event selection with information merging
- Confidence scoring for merge suggestions
- Comprehensive tag combination from all sources

## üèõÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **events**: Event information with moderation status
- **contacts**: Organizer and community member information
- **organizations**: Community organizations and partnerships
- **scraping_logs**: Event discovery monitoring
- **communication_logs**: Community engagement tracking

### Key Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Automated timestamps and triggers
- Comprehensive indexing for performance
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage
