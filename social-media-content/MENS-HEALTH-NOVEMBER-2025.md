## 🎨 Design Guidelines for Men's Health Posts

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Liberation Teal (#008B8B) - healing, wellness, calm
- **Accent**: Community Gold (#FFD700) - hope, vitality, warmth
- **Supporting**: White (#FFFFFF) on black (#000000) - clean, medical, serious

### Typography
- Bold, clear, medical-style fonts
- High contrast for accessibility
- Trigger warnings where appropriate (suicide, trauma content)

### Image Style
- Professional medical imagery
- Black queer men in healthcare settings
- Diverse body types and presentations
- Empowering, destigmatizing visuals
- UK-specific healthcare (NHS imagery)

### Content Warnings & Resource Signposting
Posts #14 (Suicide), #16 (Trauma), #23 (Chemsex), #10 (Addiction), #24 (Domestic Violence) should include:
- **In Caption**: Full crisis resources with phone numbers/websites + IVOR reference
- **In Graphic**: Key help number prominently displayed (e.g., "Crisis support: 116 123 | Ask IVOR: blkoutuk.com")
- **Content Warning**: "CW: [topic]. Support available. You're not alone."

**CRITICAL**: All posts dealing with health issues MUST include relevant help resources directly in BOTH the caption AND the graphic itself. Generic "NHS" references are insufficient - use targeted organizations.

**IVOR INTEGRATION**: Include "Ask IVOR at blkoutuk.com" in posts where people may need to find personalized resources (therapists, clinics, support groups). IVOR can help locate services specific to their area and needs.
