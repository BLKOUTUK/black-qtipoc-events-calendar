## 📁 YOU HAVE:
- ✅ CSV file ready: `MOVEMBER-REMAINING-24-VIDEOS.csv`
- ✅ Your existing Canva template (the one you used for 6 videos)

## ⏱️ TIME: 10 minutes total

---

## 🎬 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### **STEP 1: Open Your Template in Canva** (1 min)

1. Go to Canva.com
2. Open the template you used to create your first 6 videos
3. If you don't have it open, go to "Projects" and find "Movember [Topic]"

---

### **STEP 2: Access Bulk Create** (1 min)

1. In your Canva editor, look at the **left sidebar**
2. Click **"Apps"** (looks like a grid icon)
3. In the search bar, type: **"Bulk Create"**
4. Click the **"Bulk Create"** app (by Canva)
5. Click **"Use in new design"** or **"Connect data"**

**Note:** If you don't see "Bulk Create", you might need Canva Pro. Alternative: Use "Data" app or "CSV Import"

---

### **STEP 3: Upload the CSV File** (2 min)

1. Click **"Upload file"** or **"Connect data source"**
2. Select the CSV file: `MOVEMBER-REMAINING-24-VIDEOS.csv`
3. Canva will read the file and show you a preview

**CSV Structure Preview:**
```
Video_Title | Main_Headline | Body_Quote | Source_Citation | Resource_1 | Resource_2 | Call_To_Action
```

---

### **STEP 4: Map CSV Columns to Template Fields** (3 min)

Canva will show your template with text placeholders. You need to connect CSV columns to these fields:

**Example Mapping:**

| Template Field Name | CSV Column Name |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Title / Headline | `Video_Title` |
| Main Text / Quote | `Body_Quote` |
| Source / Citation | `Source_Citation` |
| Resource Link 1 | `Resource_1` |
| Resource Link 2 | `Resource_2` |
| CTA / Button Text | `Call_To_Action` |

**How to Map:**
1. Click on a text field in your template
2. Click "Connect data"
3. Select the matching CSV column from dropdown
4. Repeat for all text fields

**Pro Tip:** If field names don't match exactly, just connect them manually - Canva is flexible!

---

### **STEP 5: Generate All Videos** (2 min)

1. After mapping all fields, click **"Generate"** or **"Create designs"**
2. Canva will create **24 new video pages** based on your template
3. Wait while it processes (usually 1-2 minutes)
4. You'll see 24 new designs appear

---

### **STEP 6: Review & Download** (1 min)

1. **Quick review**: Scroll through to check they look correct
2. Click **"Download"** button (top right)
3. Select format: **"MP4 Video"**
4. Click **"Download all pages"** (not just current page!)
5. Canva will export all 24 videos as a ZIP file

**Download time:** ~2-3 minutes depending on video length

---

## 🎉 DONE! You now have 30 total videos (6 original + 24 new)

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem: "I don't see Bulk Create app"**

**Solution A:** Search for **"Data"** app instead
- Works the same way
- Upload CSV and map fields

**Solution B:** Use **manual duplication** method:
1. Duplicate your template 24 times
2. Manually update text on each page using the CSV as reference
3. Export all pages at once

---

### **Problem: "CSV columns don't match my template fields"**

**Solution:**
1. Open the CSV in Excel/Google Sheets
2. Rename column headers to match your Canva text field names
3. Save and re-upload

**Or:**
- Just map them manually in Canva (you can connect any column to any field)

---

### **Problem: "Some fields aren't updating"**

**Solution:**
1. Make sure the field is a **text field** (not an image or shape)
2. Click the field and ensure "Connect data" is enabled
3. Ungroup any grouped elements - each text box needs to be separate

---

### **Problem: "Videos look different from my original 6"**

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're using the exact same template
2. Check that colors/fonts haven't changed
3. Lock background elements so only text updates

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Tip 1: Save Template Properly**
Before bulk creating:
- File → Save as template
- Name it: "BLKOUT Movember Video Template"
- This ensures consistency

### **Tip 2: Test with 2 Videos First**
- Upload CSV with only 2 rows
- Generate those 2 videos
- Check they look perfect
- Then upload full CSV with all 24

### **Tip 3: Update CSV Anytime**
- If you need to change text, just update the CSV
- Re-upload to Canva
- Regenerate - it's faster than manual editing

### **Tip 4: Export Settings**
- Use highest quality: 1080p MP4
- Keep file size reasonable for Instagram (under 10MB)
- Canva Pro allows longer videos (up to 5 min)

## 📊 WHAT IF I NEED TO CHANGE THE CSV?

The CSV I created has 7 columns:

1. **Video_Title** - Main headline (e.g., "Movember Mental Health")
2. **Main_Headline** - Secondary headline
3. **Body_Quote** - Main text/quote from campaigns
4. **Source_Citation** - Where the stat came from
5. **Resource_1** - First help resource
6. **Resource_2** - Second help resource
7. **Call_To_Action** - Final CTA text

**To customize:**
- Open CSV in Google Sheets or Excel
- Edit any text
- Keep column structure the same
- Save as CSV
- Re-upload to Canva

---

## 🎨 ALTERNATIVE: If Bulk Create Doesn't Work

### **Manual Batch Method** (1-2 hours):

1. Open your template
2. Duplicate page 24 times (Ctrl+D or right-click → Duplicate)
3. Open the CSV as reference
4. Go through each page and update text from CSV
5. Export all pages at once as video

**Still faster than creating from scratch!**
